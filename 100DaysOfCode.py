I am signin up for Replit's 100 days of Pytnon
challenge!
I will make sure to spend some time every day coding
along, for a minumum of 10 minutes a day.
I'll be using Replit, an amazing online IDE so I can do
this from my phone wherever I happen to be.  No excuses
for not coding from the middle of a field!
I am feeling 🙏
